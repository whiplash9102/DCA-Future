CA-Future: Python Code for Leveraged Futures Trading
This Python script implements a Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy tailored for futures trading with leverage. The key idea is to invest a fixed amount of money (e.g., $1 per day) regardless of price volatility. Over a long-term horizon (e.g., 4â€“5 years), this method aims to deliver a reasonable Annualized Rate of Return (ARR) by taking advantage of the time-based strength of DCA, even in volatile markets.
